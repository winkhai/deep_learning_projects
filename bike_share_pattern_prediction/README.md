In this mini-project, I will be building my first neural network to predict bike sharing ride. This has a practical application for bicycle shops. If the shop has too few bikes, it may be losing money from potential  riders. If it has too many, the shop owner may be wasting money on bikes that are not being used. So this project will use historical data and predict  the number of bikes being needed in the near future.
