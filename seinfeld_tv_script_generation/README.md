In this project, I will be generating a new script for Seinfeld TV show  using recurrent neural network. I will trian the network on exisitng scripts and use it to generate a new 'fake' piece based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

For the training data, I will be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 

This dataset can be found here:
